## Archive
Code for previous competition years is also stored in this repository. It can be found in separate branches. Keep these branches separate and orphaned from `master` (never merge them in).

At the end of a competition year, we will make a new branch off of the `master` branch to archive that year's code. This way, we have a backup of roughly the same code that was run at the last competition for that year.
