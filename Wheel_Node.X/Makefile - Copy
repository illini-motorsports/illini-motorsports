#Every rule listed here as .PHONY is "phony": when you say you want that rule satisfied,

#`make clean` would do nothing!!!)

#The first rule in the Makefile is the default (the one chosen by plain `make`).
#Since 'all' is first in this file, both `make all` and `make` do the same thing.

#So, how does all of this work? This rule is saying

#"I am how you make the thing called client. If the thing called client is required, but doesn't 
#exist / is out of date, then the way to make it is to run 
#`$(CC) $(COMPILERFLAGS) $^ -o $@ $(LINKLIBS)`. 
#But, you can't start doing that until you are sure all of my dependencies ($(CLIENTOBJECTS)) are up to date."
#
#In this case, CLIENTOBJECTS is just obj/client.o. So, if obj/client.o doesn't exist or is out of date, 
#make will first look for a rule to build it. That rule is the 'obj/%.o' one, below; the % is a wildcard.

#The % sign means "match one or more characters". You specify it in the target, and when a file
#dependency is checked, if its name matches this pattern, this rule is used. You can also use the % 
#in your list of dependencies, and it will insert whatever characters were matched for the target name.
